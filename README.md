# 100daysofcuda
Learn, code, build using CUDA
All started with joining the discord:  https://discord.gg/4Tg4TkJQzE and getting inspired by everyone.

### Setup
Mentor: https://github.com/hkproj

### Instructions
Checkout: https://github.com/hkproj/100-days-of-cuda

### Why do this?
Want to be a stellar cuda programmer.

### Day 1
Starting Day 1 with a simple kernel. Should perform VectorAdd.
Instructions to run:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make day_1
./day_1
```

### Day 2
Day 2 commences with matrix multiplication, baseic version.
We are essentially taking:
```
    for (int row = 0; row < M; ++row) {
        for (int col = 0; col < N; ++col) {
            float p_value = 0.0f;
            for (int i = 0; i < K; ++i) {
                p_value += a[row * K + i] * b[i * N + col];
            }
            c[row * N + col] = p_value;
        }
    }
```
and utilizing the SIMT architecture of GPUs to parallelize it. The outer loops essentially get scheduled across the SMs and everything else in the basic version remains the same.

Instructions to run:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make day_2
./day_2
```
